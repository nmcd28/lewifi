There are a few floor plans included.  There isn't much point to having them, other than for  demo.

floorplan.png - one room, one door.  probably similar to the room you are in. figure out where in the room you are sitting and click there.  now wander about the room.

carlhouse.png - I made this by walking around my house and scribbling on a piece of paper.  then I scanned the paper and used gimp to make it look better.  Then I used `LeWifi -f carlhouse.png` and walked around again clicking here and there.

carlland.jpg - you better appreciate this one, because unlike when the satellite passed over, there was snow on the ground as I walked and clicked.
